This project was about measuring the quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in brain's ventricles of preterm infants using MRI. In order to calculate the quantity, segmentation was the best technique.
Nowadays we have multiples manual segmentation tehniques of MRI sequences but time is crucial and the number of MRI segmentations recquiered in a short amount of time is also an important factor to take into account.
Therefore, an automatic segmentation method would be ideal and there comes the aim of this project.

The Kmeans was the main AI algorithm used to segment ventricles. It gave an accuracy of 92% for 10 MRIs from the Necker hospital. The score was correct. Some other alghorithms were tested like region growing or DBSCAN in order to increase the accuracy but not completed.
